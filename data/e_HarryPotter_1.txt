"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" (released as "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" in the United States) is the first book in the Harry Potter series written by J.K. Rowling. It introduces readers to the magical world and follows the adventures of the young protagonist, Harry Potter.

The story begins with Harry Potter, an orphaned boy living with his cruel aunt, uncle, and cousin, who treat him poorly. On his eleventh birthday, Harry discovers that he is a wizard and receives a letter inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

Harry learns that his parents were powerful wizards who were killed by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, whose name is feared by many in the wizarding world. Harry also learns that he is famous in the wizarding community as the "Boy Who Lived," as he survived an attack by Voldemort as a baby, leaving him with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead.

At Hogwarts, Harry befriends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, who become his loyal companions. Together, they navigate the challenges of school, including classes on magic, making friends, and dealing with rivalries.

As the school year progresses, Harry discovers the existence of the Philosopher's Stone, a legendary object with the power to grant immortality. Harry, Ron, and Hermione suspect that someone is trying to steal the Stone, leading them on a dangerous quest to protect it and uncover the identity of the culprit.

In the climactic final confrontation, Harry confronts the villainous Professor Quirrell, who has been possessed by Lord Voldemort. With the help of his friends and the guidance of Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, Harry manages to defeat Quirrell and prevent Voldemort from obtaining the Philosopher's Stone.

"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" sets the stage for the magical world of Harry Potter, introduces key characters, and lays the foundation for the epic journey that awaits Harry in the subsequent books of the series.
